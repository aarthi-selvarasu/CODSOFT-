# Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
The official Iris Flower dataset is used.

## Algorithm Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Visual Studio Code

## Output
The model predicts flower species and displays accuracy along with a classification report.
